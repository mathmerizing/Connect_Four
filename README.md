*by Yerso Checya Sinti and Julian Roth* <br><br>
A Java version of the game "Connect Four". Learning about Minimax and Alpha-beta pruning.

## MODES:
- single player
- multi player

### SINGLE PLAYER:
  The user plays against a bot. <br>
  Currently supported:
  - bot playing random (possible) moves
  - bot implementing minimax and alpha-beta pruning (recommended depth: 8 [plies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ply_(game_theory)))

### MULTI PLAYER:
  User1 plays against User2 on the same PC.
 
 ## USER INPUT:
 Follow the instructions.<br>
 When asked to enter your move, please enter an integer between 0 and 6. <br>
 0 is the column on the far left and 6 is the column on the far right.

<br>

## IDEAS FOR OPTIMIZATION:
Implement [
Iterative deepening depth-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_deepening_depth-first_search) which keeps the time per move fixed and adjusts the depth of the minimax algorithm accordingly. <br>
Create a opening move database (preprocess the computationally intensive first few moves).
